        <h3>Website Evaluated: <a href="https://www.nfl.com/">NFL</a></h3>
        <p>"NFL" is a place where you can go and keep up to date with the teams you like and the scores and where they stand, and last but least it gives you an update if your player (s) are injuried and if they were they will let you know if they are okay or if their ready to come back in..... also nfl has so much details and just where you want to be because there videos of the players, theres so many other links in there that describe the rest..... and nfl isnt all aboutnfl either it has boxing, golf and other sports.</p>
